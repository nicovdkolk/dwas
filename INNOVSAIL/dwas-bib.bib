  abstract = {It is critical to be able to estimate a ship׳s response to waves, since the resulting added resistance and loss of speed may cause delays or course alterations, with consequent financial repercussions. Slow steaming has recently become a popular approach for commercial vessels, as a way of reducing fuel consumption, and therefore operating costs, in the current economic and regulatory climate. Traditional methods for the study of ship motions are based on potential flow theory and cannot incorporate viscous effects. Fortunately, unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes computations are capable of incorporating both viscous and rotational effects in the flow and free surface waves. The key objective of this study is to perform a fully nonlinear unsteady RANS simulation to predict the ship motions and added resistance of a full scale KRISO Container Ship model, and to estimate the increase in effective power and fuel consumption due to its operation in waves. The analyses are performed at design and slow steaming speeds, covering a range of regular head waves, using a commercial RANS solver. The results are validated against available experimental data and are found to be in good agreement with the experiments. Also, the results are compared to those from potential theory.},

  abstract      = {The KCS container ship was investigated in calm water and regular head seas by means of EFD and CFD. The experimental study was conducted in FORCE Technology’s towing tank in Denmark, and the CFD study was conducted using the URANS codes CFDSHIP-IOWA and Star-CCM+ plus the potential theory code AEGIR. Three speeds were covered and the wave conditions were chosen in order to study the ship’s response in waves under resonance and maximum exciting conditions. In the experiment, the heave and pitch motions and the resistance were measured together with wave elevation of the incoming wave. The model test was designed and conducted in order to enable UA assessment of the measured data. The results show that the ship responds strongly when the resonance and maximum exciting conditions are met. With respect to experimental uncertainty, the level for calm water is comparable to PMM uncertainties for maneuvering testing while the level is higher in waves. Concerning the CFD results, the computation shows a very complex and time-varying flow pattern. For the integral quantities, a comparison between EFD and CFD shows that the computed motions and resistance in calm water is in fair agreement with the measurement. In waves, the motions are still in fair agreement with measured data, but larger differences are observed for the resistance. The mean resistance is reasonable, but the first order amplitude of the resistance time history is underpredicted by CFD. Finally, it seems that the URANS codes are in closer agreement with the measurements compared to the potential theory.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents an investigation of the approximation property of neural networks with unbounded activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which is the new de-facto standard of deep learning. The ReLU network can be analyzed by the ridgelet transform with respect to Lizorkin distributions. By showing three reconstruction formulas by using the Fourier slice theorem, the Radon transform, and Parseval's relation, it is shown that a neural network with unbounded activation functions still satisfies the universal approximation property. As an additional consequence, the ridgelet transform, or the backprojection filter in the Radon domain, is what the network learns after backpropagation. Subject to a constructive admissibility condition, the trained network can be obtained by simply discretizing the ridgelet transform, without backpropagation. Numerical examples not only support the consistency of the admissibility condition but also imply that some non-admissible cases result in low-pass filtering.},
